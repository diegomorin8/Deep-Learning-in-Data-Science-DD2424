    "The main objective of this assignment is to train a RNN to synthesize English text character by character. The training will be done using the text from the book _Harry potter and The Goblet of Fire_ by J.K.Rowling. AdaGrad was used as the main optimizing function. The main steps that were perfomed during the implementation of the current Assignment were: \n",
    "1. __Preparing Data__: Read in the training data, determine the number of unique characters in the text and set up mapping functions - one mapping each character to a unique index and another mapping each index to a character.\n",
    "2. __Back-propagation__: The forward and the backward pass of the backpropagation algorithm for a vanilla RNN to efficiently compute the gradients.\n",
    "3. __AdaGrad updating__ the RNN’s parameters.\n",
    "4. __Synthesizing__ text from the RNN: Given a learnt set of parameters for the RNN, a default initial hidden state h0 and an initial input vector, x0, from which to bootstrap from then you will write a function to generate a sequence of text."
