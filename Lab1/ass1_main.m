% Introduction
%
% In this assignment a two layer network with multiple outputs will be
% trained to classify images from the dataset CIFAR-10. The network will be
% trained using minibatch gradient descent applied to a cost function that
% computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled
% training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.
  

    % The first step is to prepare the workspace

    %Prepare the workspace

        % Load the data
        % 
        % We will use the images in data_batch_1.mat as the training data. However
        % this data has to be modified and adapted to our requirements. This is
        % done by the function LoadBatch. This function loads the data we need, and
        % outputs 3 parameters: 
        %   - X: contains the image pixel data, has size dxN, is of type double or
        %     single and has entries between 0 and 1. N is the number of images
        %     (10000) and d the dimensionality of each image (3072=32×32×3).
        %   - Y: is K×N (K= # of labels = 10) and contains the one-hot representation
        %     of the label for each image.
        %   - N: is a vector of length N containing the label for each image. A note
        %     of caution. CIFAR-10 encodes the labels as integers between 0-9 but
        %     Matlab indexes matrices and vectors starting at 1. Therefore it may be
        %     easier to encode the labels between 1-10.
