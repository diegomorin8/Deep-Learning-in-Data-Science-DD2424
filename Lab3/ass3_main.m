% Introduction
%
% In this assignment a two layer network with multiple outputs will be
% trained to classify images from the dataset CIFAR-10. The network will be
% trained using minibatch gradient descent applied to a cost function that
% computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled
% training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

    %   2. Randomly initalized the network. It should perform similarly to a random
